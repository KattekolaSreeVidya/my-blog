## What I Learned
1. Learned how to start a React project using Vite, which makes the setup and development faster.
2. I learned how to implement a dark mode toggle using React's `useState and conditionally applying a class to the body and components.
3. Got familiar with basic npm commands like npm install to add dependencies and npm run dev to start the development server.
4. Built a Header component, which taught me how to make and style reusable parts in React.
